DS18B20 Fake tester sketch
This sketch tests all resolutions of DS18B20, writes values in alarm triger registers, and measures comversion time, it uses OLed dispay as Output (or serial.).
Fake sensor doesn't support 9, 10-bit resolution, and doesent store values in alarm registers. Also my fake sensor has a very short conversion time of 35 ms at 12bit, normal sensor need about 600 ms at 12bit
